          <span>Dear Shreya,</span>
          <br />
           Arz kiya hai...
          Ulfat k darr pe furkat ka yun sharmaana,
          Ulfat k darr pe furkat ka yun sharmaana
          Aur upar waali line samajh aa jaaye
          Toh mujhe jarur batana
          Funny? .....yeah right. It had to be. Kyunki mere ko nhi samajh aa rha mai kya likhu.
          Ok, so let me start with saying 'Thank You'. Thank you for being here and even when you were not, 
          thank you for not being there because if you would've been, I wouldn't have come this far.
          "Sometimes correct words from the correct person areÂ  enough to make you strong" 
          Thanks for being that person for me. 
          "Some people are just light. You see them and you suddenly feel so warm inside and all you want to
          do is hug them. And they look at you and smile with the warmest light in their eyes.... and you love
           them." ........You are my 'some' people. 
          Thank you for being the source of my happiness, joy, inspiration and sometimes of tears as well.
          Our journey as friends has been an open eye witness to the changing seasons, with occasional storms 
          testing the strength of our bond. yet like the resilient castle we kept standing firm against the wind.
          'YOU KEPT'.......I really hope you'll keep doing that in real life as well.
          Just as the sun emerges after a heavy rain, so too have we emerged, stronger and more appreciative of 
          each other's presence. And I know and guarantee, there'll be tough times. I also guarantee that at some 
          point, one or both of us wanna get out of one thing. But, I also guarantee that we'll sort everything out together. 
          Because....."Love isn't two people who don't fight. It's two people who take turns saying: 
          "I'm so sorry. Let's try that talk again."
          Our journey together wasn't as sweet as the fragrance of roses but the thorns were also the part of it and will be. 
          Here's to many more petals of shared laughter and joy, more madness, more mess, more trips, more hustle and success, 
          tears and laughter, more epic events and more and more of youuu!!
